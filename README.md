## Introduction

The Netflix Clone project is a static web page that replicates the basic user interface of Netflix. This project was an excellent opportunity to practice and enhance my skills in HTML and CSS, focusing on layout, design, and responsiveness.

## Features

- **Responsive Design**: The layout adjusts seamlessly across different screen sizes.
- **Navigation Bar**: A top navigation bar similar to Netflixâ€™s, including a logo and menu items.
- **Hero Section**: A featured section with a large background image and call-to-action buttons.
- **Movie/Show Cards**: Displays a list of movies/shows in a grid layout, similar to Netflix's interface.
- **Footer**: A simple footer with links to various sections of the website.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5**: For the structure and content of the web pages.
- **CSS3**: For styling and layout, including flexbox and grid for responsive design.
